PYSOS

Pysos is being re-designed to actually be, well, not crap.

Most of the modules have been properly re-structured into actual, proper modules.

pysos.py is the file to run against, using the same switches (and help menu) as before.


I'll work on making this a proper README shortly, but for now what you do is:

1) Pull down the contents of this repo into:
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

2) Drop a symlink anywhere in your $PATH
